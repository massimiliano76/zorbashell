## How to Install Zorba CMD
Zorba itself should just work copying the source code using git, just run this commands on GNU/Linux:
```
sudo -s
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/zorbaproject/zorbashell.git
./install.sh
```
You'll be asked a few questions about what you would actually like to install. If you are not sure, just install everything answering 'y'.

If you don't want Zorba to be run only by root, you may use /opt folder instead of /root.

## How to run ZorbaShell vocal assistant
Run zorbashell with -v argument:
```
./zorbashell.py -v
```
Of course you'll need a working microphone.
